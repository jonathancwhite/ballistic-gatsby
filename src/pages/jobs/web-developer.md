    ### Role Overview


    Ballistic Agency is a US-based UI/UX design and development agency that specializes in E-Commerce and web-based application services. Our industry knowledge and our SHAFT industry focus separate us from other agencies in the market, and thus are struggling to keep up with demand! We are looking for an addition to the team who is flexible and enjoys working with others in a team-oriented environment.


    Our fast-growing team needs a new Web Developer! You will learn everything there is to know about making world-class websites. Our agency is not married to any specific technologies, so you will work with whatever tools best meet our clients' needs; however, the majority of our clients are E-Commerce merchants with stores on BigCommerce or Shopify. Clients come to us with problems, and you will build the solution!


    This position is a full-time position. You will work closely with other members of the development team as well as the Technical Director.

    * The position includes health benefits that are made available after 60 days.

    * This position includes a bonus program.

    * Paid holidays.

    * Parental leave.

    * 401K contribution available.


    *NOTE: Starting pay varies depending on experience.*


    ### Responsibilities


    As a Web developer for our team, you will fulfill a wide array of client needs. Duties may include, but are not limited to:


    * Develop new E-Commerce sites (typically on the two largest SaaS platforms, Shopify and BigCommerce).

    * Build out fully-functional E-Commerce pages to a pixel-perfect match of a provided design mockup.

    * Add new features and functionality to existing E-Commerce sites.

    * Create custom integrations between E-Commerce platforms and third-party applications.

    * Ensure the code behind a website adheres to WCAG guidelines.


    ### Necessary Skills


    * Understanding client requirements (regardless of how they are presented), and translating them into effective and usable experiences.

    * High attention to detail.

    * Demonstrated aptitude for learning new technologies.

    * Ability to effectively communicate with the design department to assess how elements should function.

    * Strong understanding of web and mobile best practices and trends.


    ### Required Experience


    * A Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or 1-2 years experience working with Javascript or equivalent.

    * Proficiency in HTML5 and CSS.

    * Experience working with version-control software.

    * A minimum of 1 year of experience working with jQuery.

    * Knowledge of an E-Commerce platform (Shopify or BigCommerce) and its templating language.

    * Eager to learn from senior developers - and improve upon their work.

    * Ability to solve business problems first and write code second - not the other way around!


    ### Preferred Experience


    * Proficiency in SASS.

    * Experience in AJAX and JSON.

    * A powerful desire to become the best at developing E-Commerce sites.

    * 1+ year experience working with Webpack.
