    ### Role Overview

We are looking for an addition to the team who is flexible and enjoys working with others in a team-oriented environment.


    Our fast-growing team needs a new Web Developer! You will learn everything there is to know about making world-class websites. Our agency is not married to any specific technologies, so you will work with whatever tools best meet our clients' needs; however, the majority of our clients are E-Commerce merchants with stores on BigCommerce or Shopify. Clients come to us with problems, and you will build the solution!


    This position is a full-time position. You will work closely with other members of the development team as well as the Technical Director.

    * Parental leave.

    * 401K contribution available.


    *NOTE: Starting pay varies depending on experience.*


    ### Responsibilities


    As a Web developer for our team, you will fulfill a wide array of client needs. Duties may include, but are not limited to:


    * Develop new E-Commerce sites (typically on the two largest SaaS platforms, Shopify and BigCommerce).

    * Build out fully-functional E-Commerce pages to a pixel-perfect match of a provided design mockup.

    * Add new features and functionality to existing E-Commerce sites.

    * Create custom integrations between E-Commerce platforms and third-party applications.

    * Ensure the code behind a website adheres to WCAG guidelines.
